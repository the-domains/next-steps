Day 1: 2 Corinthians 5:17 (AMP)

"Therefore if any person is \[ingrafted\] in Christ (the Messiah) he is a new creation (a new creature altogether); the old \[previous moral and spiritual condition\] has passed away. Behold, the fresh and new has come!"

Believe it or not, your decision to follow Christ has created a new life for you! God is giving you a fresh start, regardless of past mistakes, poor decisions, or other things that you wish you could change about your life. God is not holding those things against you, so you shouldn't either! Your "previous moral and spiritual condition" has passed away, so accept the gift of a brand new beginning!
